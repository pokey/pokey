### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am the creator of [Cursorless](https://www.cursorless.org/).  I no longer work full-time on Cursorless, but still help when I can

I work freelance. I'm not currently looking for new projects, but I love talking about interesting stuff, so please ping me on [Twitter](https://x.com/PokeyRule) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/pokeyrule.bsky.social) to chat!
