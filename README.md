### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I build open-source voice coding tools like [Cursorless](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pokey.cursorless).  Lately, I've been obsessed with the following question:

*How can we leverage the phenomenal power of human language to interact with code in new ways?*

I'm working on [a spoken language](https://github.com/pokey/cursorless-vscode/wiki/What's-next) for large-scale, structurally aware voice-controlled code generation and refactoring.

If that excites you, get involved! Comment on [the issues](https://github.com/pokey/cursorless-vscode/projects), comment on [my videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCML02pamUSxtbwAcrUdVmXg), hack on [some code](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless-vscode/contribute), join the [Talon slack](https://talonvoice.com/chat), tweet [at me](https://twitter.com/PokeyRule), and consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/pokey) ðŸ˜Š
